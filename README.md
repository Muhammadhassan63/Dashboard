The Admin Dashboard is a web-based application designed to provide administrators with a powerful and user-friendly interface for managing various aspects of the system. This dashboard is built based on the design provided in Figma, ensuring a consistent and visually appealing user experience.

## Features

- **Tabular Data Display:** The main feature of this Admin Dashboard is the display of tabular data with columns such as "Email Address," "Report Failed," "Report Generated," "Total Cost," and "Actions." The data is presented in a clean and organized format, allowing administrators to quickly access and manage information.

- **Sortable Data:** Administrators can sort the data in ascending or descending order based on the "Total Cost" field by simply clicking the "Sort" button. This feature enables easy analysis and helps administrators identify patterns in the data.

- **Filterable Data:** The dashboard provides a filter option that allows administrators to enter a specific value for the "Total Cost" field and filter the data accordingly. This feature simplifies the process of finding specific records based on custom criteria.

- **Action Icons:** Each row in the table displays an email address, report failure count, report generation count, total cost, and two action icons. These action icons represent different actions that can be performed on each row, providing administrators with quick access to essential functions.
